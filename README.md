Twitter-GLib - A library wrapping the Twitter RESTful API
===============================================================================

**WARNING**: Twitter-GLib is unmaintained; it uses the deprecated v1 API, and
does not support the stream API. It also does not use OAuth so it's basically
useless for anything that requires authentication. Twitter-GLib is mostly meant
as a historical archive.

Twitter-GLib is a GObject-based library providing a wrapper around
the RESTful API of Twitter.

  Twitter is for staying in touch and keeping up with friends no matter
  where you are or what youâ€™re doing. For some friends you might want
  instant mobile updates - for others, you can just check the web. Invite
  your friends to Twitter and decide how connected you want you to be.
                -- from http://twitter.com

In short, is a web-based SMS-like service.
